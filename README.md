# iOS_Calculator_Tutorial

This will be a beginner's tutorial for making Application on the iPhone. Not all concepts will be explained in detail, so if you have anything you don't understand, don't worry, it's normal.



We are going to create an Application in which we will perform basic some calculations of maths. We can say it a calculator.This is how Main part looks like.

Select **single view application** then fill in the App's name, we will creatively name it "Calculatordemo", make sure the language is set to swift and don't worry about the other fields.
Before we change anything, run the app on the simulator by pressing the "play" button on top of xcode window. Let's get started.
